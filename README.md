# Flight_Tracker
This will collect data from opensky-network on specified planes and post to twitter when a trip is completed


I chose to make a project that would get data from airplanes and then plot them out and tweet about the routes they flew. 
One of the main reasons  to do this was that I wanted to learn more about using APIs and how to store and work with data, 
Summary: Data is hard. To get the data, you basically need to poll the API at regular intervals and store it yourself.
Resources: The internet, stackoverflow, google mainly
In designing this program I had to split the data acquisition and the processing as I needed to let the data accumulate for days. 
The two things I’ve realized that I need to know more on are how to process the data to be more useful so that I can build better visuals and improve the information I’m getting.
